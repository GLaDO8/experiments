## How to start stuff

Modern surveillance systems heavily rely on digital means for eavesdropping and espionage. Heavy R&D in various technological advancements have significantly decreased their price, further pushing the boundaries of digital surveillance and stating their pervasiveness. This paper will be focusing on how different forms of digital surveillance are being deployed to target and monitor activities of individuals of a specific gender and race, with a few discussions related to neo-patriarchy and macho societies.

In 2016, Karisma Foundation (Fundación Karisma), a digital rights organization in Columbia, held workshops and conducted many studies with woman journalists, workers and housewives of Columbia, to better understand how the macho state government’s surveillance systems were affecting women . The study found out that Columbian woman considered it normal to share credentials for their digital identities, and allow their significant others to control their social accounts and online presence.

Recently, Apple and Google were put under spotlight when critics found out about ‘Absher’, an e-governance portal by the Saudi government to access an array of services offered by them . One of these features was a portal for Saudi males to manage travel allowances for their spouse.

Under Saudi Arabia’s Guardianship laws, a woman can’t marry, travel, divorce or get a job without permission from their husband .The Absher app is Saudi government’s beacon to leverage the power of digital technologies while justifying it in the name of Islamic law. Apple and Google joined hands with Saudi Arabia and decided not to ban the apps on their respective app markets .

In both these cases, there are strong roots of patriarchy backed with historical, socio-cultural and religious laws and significance. Islamic law considers women as an inferior sex. The Koran states that the supremacy of the male is Allah’s wish and that it is his command that women should be under male control .

There have been many cases of Saudi women fleeing their country to evade their religion’s guardianship laws. Saudi woman Dina Ali Lasloom, made a failed attempt to take refuge in Australia to escape Saudi guardianship laws . Saudi teen Rahaf-Al-Qunun managed to secure refuge in Canada, by publicizing her plea on Twitter, which gained international momentum . Another Saudi female Nojoud al-Mandeel, turned to social media to get help and protection from her abusive dad .

This isn’t a recent phenomenon. Cases of females trying to flee their home country have been recorded as early as the 70s . What has changed since then are the dynamics of the situation. With the exponential growth in the IT sector since the 90s, we see the incorporation of various technologies in what has been culturally and historically idle. The Saudi prince stated in a press conference that he is trying to Islam more liberal and tolerant towards woman, but the change is going to be hard as families don’t want it to happen. Men are content with the reinforcement of surveillance on the woman in the house because of the app ‘Absher’.

This connects with Castell’s concept of ‘real virtuality’ . In his book, Rise of Network Societies, Castell says,

‘real virtuality is a system in which reality itself (that is, people’s material/symbolic existence) is entirely captured, fully immersed in a virtual image setting, in the world of make-believe, in which appearances are not just on the screen through which experience is communicated, but they become the experience.’

Castell says that all reality as we know is virtually perceived. What characterizes the ‘Absher’ app is its comprehensiveness and inclusion of the situation in a digital form. It is its versatility and low barrier for entry (because of its clubbing with other e-governance services) that interests diverse group of Saudi families. But what this digital application failed to include is the fragility and social implications of the problem.

There has been little sociological research done on this matter, and hence the effects of this form of digital surveillance are yet to be known.
