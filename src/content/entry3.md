## how to start stuff

You’ve probably been in situations where you feel like a caveman in a restaurant, have no clue what to order. Maybe you came by a surprise seeing all the things the place serves, or probably you have no clue what “bruschetta al pomodoro” is. Don’t worry, even I end up googling stuff most of the time. Cuisines can be a huge pain in the…umm…brain?

But cuisines can explain a lot of things about the place of origin. Every morsel that melts on your tongue has a story behind it. Every cuisine was born out revised perfection and love for centuries. If Ramsay Gordon’s love for detail and perfectionism isn’t sufficient, I’d say it again, believe it or not - there are some core elements, principles, and guidelines which form the base framework on which the food is prepared.

**Mediterranean** - _olive (gives olive oil), wheat (gives the bread and pasta) and grape (gives the wine)_

Mediterranean cuisine is a broad view of food from the Mediterranean basin, with regions like Greece, Italy, Egypt, French etc. Though generalized, each of these regions has very different food and culture.

The way food is prepared and had changes vastly as we move from northern to Southern Europe. Beer is replaced with wine and butter with olive oil. Many people, even nutritionists believe that following a Mediterranean diet is the healthiest. Olive oil cleans your coronary tracts and vessels. Each color in vegetables represents different type of anti-oxidants and nutrients. More than the food, its the social life it promotes. Celebrating and enjoying harvests of wheat, grapes, and olives with friends and families while dancing and laughing is the key to a happy life! Now go have some pasta will ya ?!

**Japanese** - _sea (gives sashimi and sushi), rice (gives the boiled rice and noodles)_

Although part of Japanese food is inspired from their neighbors, the Chinese, Japan’s cultural isolation for a long time (till the 19th century) due to geographic reasons can be clearly seen in their native, staple dishes. Boiled sticky rice with exotic seafood wrapped in nutrient-rich sea plants? Where else can you see this?

**Mexican** - _Maze (corn), Chilli peppers, Avacados, tomatos, zucchini_

Mexican food has been substantially influenced by the Spanish invasion of the Aztec empire (One of the cradles of modern Mexico. Other empires include Mayan, Toltec etc). Spanish empire failed in imposing their own culture and food among the Aztecs. We should be lucky as that could have been the end of tacos and nachos! We should credit them for bringing meat into the Mexican cuisine though. It's interesting that despite the introduction of wheat and rice in Mexico, corn remained the primary starch. This would be your first nod at how cuisines represent the very culture and the way people think.

**Indian** - Indian cuisine would be the most sophisticated one of all. Given the level of diversity in our country, the food culture changes rapidly as you travel across the country. British Invasion and settlement in the Bengal opened up seaports. Fishing emerged as a primary source of income for many households and fish eventually became (or stereotyped?) the core element in their food. Jain vegetarianism’s influence on Gujarati food brought in interesting ways of using pulses and vegetables. Despite being known for the consumption of rice, south Indian states aren’t the leading rice-producing states in India. Nevertheless, rice has heavily influenced almost all the famous dishes of south India. It’s one of the primary ingredients in idli, dosa, Wada, Pongal....you name it. No wonder why Indians are prone to diabetes. The Nizam rule in Telangana brought in the world famous dish, Biryani. Rise in Muslim population brought in Lebanese cuisine.

**Chinese** - _Soy (soybean and tofu), rice, noodles, vegetables, meat_

Yes, Manchuria is a place. No Manchurian is not exactly Chinese cuisine. It’s fascinating to see Manchurian, noodles and the Chinese dishes even in almost all Indian restaurants. They actually belong to a fusion of food culture called Hakka cuisine. Chinese mass migration (Chinese diaspora) is the reason why we can see elements of their cuisine in Japanese food and even in our food.

It is Chinese food with seasoning and flavor, with a wide variety of vegetarian dishes favoring Indian tongues. The Chinese greatly value the principles of gastronomy. Their food was meticulously crafted over ages with medicinal beliefs and health in mind.

I’ve always believed that food wasn’t offered to us by Mother Earth for gobbling up when hungry, but was to relish and fall in love daily.

Enjoy food, don’t just eat it. _Bon Appétit!_
